<h1>Differences in Google Docs vs HTML</h1>
<h2>by Joshua Da Silva</h2>
<p>As a user of both Google docs and HTML, some key differences are apparent to me. 
    I feel that in my experience, Google docs is much more user friendly, with users being able to type with ease whenever they want.
    Customization in google docs compared to HTML is also much easier, as with Google docs customizationmenus are described very effecively
    and are easy to understand. HTML on the other hand I would say needs more skill and experience to utilize effectively, along with prior
    knowledge of different commands to be able to code effectively. HTML has it's cons as well, with being more oriented towards site building
    rather than Google docs. Not only that, but there is a plethora of different commands you can do on HTML pertaining to building sites, that
    Google Docs does not offer. Overall, i'd say that both sites have their pros and cons.
