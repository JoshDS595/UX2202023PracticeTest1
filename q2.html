<h1>Differences between Google Docs and HTML</h1>
<h2>by Joshua Da Silva</h2>
<p>As a user of both Google docs and HTML, some key differences are apparent to me. <br>
    I feel that in my experience, Google docs is much more user friendly, with users being able to type whatever they want with ease. <br>
    Customization in Google docs compared to HTML is also much easier, as with Google docs customization menus are described very effecively <br>
    and are easy to understand. HTML on the other hand I would say needs more skill and experience to utilize effectively, along with prior <br>
    knowledge of different commands to be able to code effectively. HTML has another key difference as well, with it being more oriented towards site building <br>
    rather than Google docs. Not only that, but there is a plethora of different commands you can do on HTML pertaining to building sites, that <br>
    Google Docs does not offer. Overall, i'd say that both sites have their pros and cons.
