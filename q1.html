<h2>... Separating content from presentation</h2>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
I find that the "strong" and "em" tags are better than the "i" and "b" tags <br>
because they are easier to understand for those who look at the code. Rather than <br>
just using letters for bold and italics, strong and em (short for emphasized) <br>
communicates to the users looking at code that this text should be strong and emphasized. <br>
As for "i" and "b", this may not be communicated as easily at first glance.
